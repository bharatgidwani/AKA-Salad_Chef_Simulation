Tasks Done : 
Player Control : Press A,B,C,D,E OR F from keyboard to select a particular vegetable.

Score Criteria : a. if customer did not wait more than the expected waiting time then score will be -> Total score + (100 - Time taken by player to serve) b. if customer is served wrong dish then score will be -> Total Score - 100(Penalty) c. if customer waited more than the expected time but served right dish then score will be -> Total score - Extra Time wait(No extra points will be given )

Randomization: No of customers and their orders will be in random order.

Waiting Time:  For now I assumed customers are in a queue so waiting time will be in increasing order with maximum serving period of 30s. We can extend this feature by changing waiting time with the no of ingredients.

Customers: a. Served : if customer did not wait more than the expected waiting time. b. Angry: if customer is not served with the right dish c. dissatisfied: if customer is not served within the expected time interval

Remaining tasks:-

1. Remaining Tasks: 
a.Implementation of different pickups: 
b. Changing waiting time with the no of ingredients. For now I just assumed customers are in a queue . So if 1st customer has waiting time of 30s then 2nd customer will have 60s of waiting time.
